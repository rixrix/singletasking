=============

A dead simple, horribly easy, like a walk-in-the-park web todo app that lets you throw in your current task(s) - hit the start or end button, then forget about it at the end of the day. You just need the details anyway because, I would assume, you're using an existing awesome-cloud-based-company-wide-web-based-big-brother-sort-of-thing task management tool or timeshit to transfer your time logs.
