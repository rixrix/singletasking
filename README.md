SingleTasking
=============

A dead simple, horribly easy, yes web-based, like a walk-in-the-park web todo app that lets you throw in your current task and forget about it at the end of the day. You just need the details anyway, I would assume, you're using an existing awesome-cloud-based-company-wide-web-based timesheet, timesuit, task tracking or PM tool for you logs.
